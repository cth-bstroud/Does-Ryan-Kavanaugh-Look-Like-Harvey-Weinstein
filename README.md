# The Quest To Find Out If Does Ryan Kavanaugh Look Like Harvey Weinstein?

Right so, all of the images and music from this game are either from https://unsplash.com/ or https://doesryankavanaughlooklikeharveyweinstein.com/.

Frankly, Ren'Py was not the right engine for this game. I was thinking I could do a point and click sort of adventure similar to games like Leisure Suit Larry or Kings Quest. But, while Ren'Py can do that it's really built for visual novels. I know there are some great games written in Ren'Py that don't stick to a visual novel format exclusively but that would require a lot of work that I wasn't willing to put in for a short meme game. 

I'll either remake this game in GameMaker Studio or stop the project all together. Granted, Ren'Py is a fantastic game engine and a great way to learn the basics of programming or for making visual novels. 

I've included the source files in case there is an issue with the build files. I guess when installing from a package manager on Linux some of the needed build files are missing. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
